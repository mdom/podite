=head1 NAME

podite - Command line podcast aggregator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  podite

=head1 DESCRIPTION

podite downloads podcasts from a set of subscribed rss and atom feeds. You
can add feeds by url or search for them on gpodder.net. Feeds can be
deactivated if you are currently not interested in them without loosing
the information which episode you already downloaded. Episodes can be
hidden, so they will not clutter your screen (unless you want to!).

=head1 INSTALLATION

The easiest way to install podite is with
L<cpanminus|https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus>:

  cpanm git://github.com/mdom/podite.git

=head1 USAGE

I<podite> is a menu based tool. Just calling podite will bring you to the main
menu. Every submenu or action has a preceding number. You can choose an entry
by entering its number and pressing enter.

When you start podite, it will update all your feeds and print an
overwview. For every feed it will print its new items, skipped items and
the total number of items. You can always update your feeds again by using
the main menu action I<update> or print your feed stats with I<status>.

In general, when the prompt ends with a single E<gt>, you can pick
only one of the choices given. When the prompt ends with double E<gt>,
you can make more than one selection, either seperated with spaces or
commas. You can also use ranges. E.g. "2-5 7,9" to choose 2,3,4,5,7,9
from the list. If the second number in a range is omitted, all remaining
choices are selected. E.g. "7-" to choose 7,8,9 from the list. You can
say I<*> to choose everything.

You can leave menus by pressing I<CTRL-D>. This will also abort an action
when prompted for arguments.
